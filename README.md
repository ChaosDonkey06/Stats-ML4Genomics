**scientific question.** how does genotypic information alone (sequencing data) predict a (viral) phenotype?

**system.** Dengue virus. is a virus of the flaviviral family (cite), sometimes referred to as arbovirus that stands for arthropod borne transmitted virus. these vectors are mosquitoes of the *Aedes* genus and two species *A. aegypti* and *A. albopictus* are the ones responsible of transmission. both species have a specialized ecological niche, *aegypti* is responsible for the urban transmission and likely specialized in feeding on human blood and breeding in human made water bodies around the XXXX in Africa and *albopictus* feeds mainly on animals and breed on natural water bodies thus is more commonly found in the sylvatic transmission cycle (cite).

These 4 viruses cause mild or no symptoms on the first infection of the virus but on the secondary infection disease is severe by a mechanism named Antibody Dependent Enhacement (ADE, cite). The severity of disease on the secondary infection

**data.** sequence data from all 4 serotypes of dengue virus: DENV1, n=1026 sequences, DENV2=796, DENV3=625 and DENV4=477, for a total of 2924 sequences. The sequences are already aligned and each one have 10188 bp.

From the data I created a phylogeny that represent the evolutionary history of that DENV. We will use both the sequence data and the phylogeny to investigate/ask how does sequence data (genotypic information) could be leveraged to predict a viral phenotype? In this case we will investigate


**methodology.** sequence data have a lot more information that just the sequences by for example creating a phylogeny. although, that requires some natural history knowledge, or assume mutation rates and demographic changes. but in general, one could build a tree easily.

# Logistic Regression.
**scientific question.** how does the transcription profile change with disease?

**data.** clinical disease data from all 4 serotypes of dengue virus.

**methodology.** sequence data have a lot more information that just the sequences by creating

# Tree based classifiers.
