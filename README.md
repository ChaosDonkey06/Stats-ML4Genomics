**scientific question.** how does genotypic information alone (sequencing data) predict a (viral) phenotype?

**system.** Dengue virus. is a virus of the flaviviral family (cite), sometimes referred to as arbovirus that stands for arthropod borne transmitted virus. these vectors are mosquitoes of the *Aedes* genus and two species *A. aegypti* and *A. albopictus* are the ones responsible of transmission. both species have a specialized ecological niche, *aegypti* is responsible for the urban transmission and likely specialized in feeding on human blood and breeding in human made water bodies around the XXXX in Africa and *albopictus* feeds mainly on animals (including humans) and breed on natural water bodies thus is more commonly found in the sylvatic transmission cycle (cite).

These 4 viruses cause mild or no symptoms on the first infection but on the secondary infection disease is severe by a mechanism named Antibody Dependent Enhacement (ADE, cite). The severity of disease on the secondary infection depends on the amount of DENV antibodies built on the first infection and with a narrow range of DENVab resulting in severe disease. However, secondary infections with viruses of the same serotype as the one of the first infection are impossible, and this is named homotypic (same serotype) lifelong cross-protection. The heterotypic secondary infections 

infections with two viruses of the same serotype are 

**data.** sequence data from all 4 serotypes of dengue virus: DENV1, n=1026 sequences, DENV2=796, DENV3=625 and DENV4=477, for a total of 2924 sequences. The sequences are already aligned and each one has 10188 bp.

From the data I created a phylogeny that represent the evolutionary history of that DENV. We will use both the sequence data and the phylogeny to investigate/ask how does sequence data (genotypic information) could be leveraged to predict a viral phenotype?

**methodology.**

# Logistic Regression.
**scientific question.** how does the transcription profile change with disease?

**data.** clinical disease data from all 4 serotypes of dengue virus.

**methodology.** sequence data have a lot more information that just the sequences by creating

# Tree based classifiers.
